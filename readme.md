## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox Css

### What I learned

This the css design code snippet of the hero container image, where i learned to placed the image within the parent div as required.

```css
.hero-image {
  object-fit: cover; /* Does not scale the image */
  object-position: 50% 35%; /*Center the image within the element*/
  height: 100%;
  width: 100%;
}
```

### Continued development

I have still a lot to practise on positioning.The website is static, responsive is reuired.
